HAU Online Graduate School Application Portal
============================================
_Powered by [CodeIgniter](https://ellislab.com/blog/entry/codeigniter-2.1.4-released)._

Overview
--------
This open-source web application aims to simplify the student application process all the way from inquiry to acceptance, effectively reducing personnel overhead associated with such activities. It will let applicants, at any time, check the status of their application on either desktop or mobile device.

Requirements
------------
* PHP version 5.1.6 or newer.
* A Database is required for most web application programming. Current supported databases are MySQL (4.1+), MySQLi, MS SQL, Postgres, Oracle, SQLite, and ODBC.
* An Apache web server (e.g. XAMPP/LAMP)

Additional information
---------------------
* Documentation for CodeIgniter 2.xx can be viewed [here](http://www.codeigniter.com/userguide2/).

To-do
-----
* Add `.env` support to set environments.
* Create a shell script to Bootstrap the application on first use.
* As CodeIgniter 2.1.4 is no longer maintained, it would be a good decision to [upgrade to version 3.xx](1) or port the application to Symfony/Laravel.
